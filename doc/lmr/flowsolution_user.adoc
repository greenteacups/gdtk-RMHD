= FlowSolution

In a preparation script, the `FlowSolution` object is used
to initialise the domain with a flow field from another
(completed) job.

 FlowSolution:new{jobName, dir, tindx, nBlocks, gindx, make_kdtree}

`jobName` ::
    _string_, no default +
    base file name for completed simulation

`dir` ::
    _string_, no default +
    directory containing completed simulation +
    It is often easy to use relative paths if the simulation is nearby.

`tindx` ::
    _int_ or _string_, no default +
    time index at which to read flow field from completed simulation +
    provide an integer for the time index,
    or to get the last flow field, one can supply the special
    string `"last"`.

`nBlocks` ::
    _int_, no default +
    number of blocks in completed simulation. +
    Note that if you provide a value _smaller_ than the
    total number of blocks in the completed simulation,
    then only blocks up to `nBlocks-1` will be used
    to initialise the flow field. A use case for this would
    if one only want to use some inflow portion of the
    domain when intialising a new simulation.

`gindx` ::
    _int_ or _string_, default = -1 +
    grid time index at which to read the grid associated with the flow field +
    For the default value of -1, the grid time index is synced with the `tindx`
    choice. This is likely what you want for moving grids, and for non-moving
    grids this will just pick up the grid at grid time index 0. +
    A special use for this `gindx` parameter is when attempting to initialise
    a moving grid simulation from a non-moving grid simulation. You can set the grid time
    index explicitly to 0 so that the non-moving flow solution is read in with
    its initial grid at grid time index 0.

`make_kdtree` ::
    _int_, default = 0 +
    when make_kdtree is selected (=1) the search speed for locating cells
    is considerably improved. It does this by using a kd tree filtering
    and sorting approach.
    There is, however, a startup cost for building the kd tree.

Example of use:

 initial = FlowSolution:new{jobName='sphere', dir='../inviscid',
                            tindx=10, nBlocks=4, make_kdtree=1}
