= Block objects

== FluidBlock objects

We decompose the fluid simulation domain into blocks.
Our simplest decomposition would be one block to represent the entire domain).
We call these units of decomposition `FluidBlocks`.
The input script is largely focussed on configuring `FluidBlocks` to
represent the fluid simulation domain.
The configuration includes setting boundary conditions and the initial state.
The full list of options are described here.

 FluidBlock:new{grid, initialState,
                bcList|bcDict,
                active, label, omegaz, may_be_turbulent}

`grid` ::
  `StructuredGrid` or `UnstructuredGrid` object, no default +
  A grid object must be supplied. The type of grid (structured
  or unstructured) sets the type of block. The grid dimensions
  should also be compatible with the global setting for dimenions.
  (See: <<config-dimensions,`config.dimensions`>>)

`initialState` ::
  <<FlowState,`FlowState`>>, <<FlowSolution,`FlowSolution`>> or a user-defined function +
  The fluid simulation domain requires an initial set of flow properties throughout
  the domain.
  These flow properties are set block-by-block using this `initialState` parameter.
  There is no default: the user must supply something for this parameter. +
   +
  Most commonly, a <<FlowState,`FlowState`>> object is given as the initial state for
  a block.
  This sets spatially-uniform flow properties across the entire block. +
   +
  A <<FlowSolution,`FlowSolution`>> object might also be used to set the initial
  flow state in a block.
  Usually the `FlowSolution` comes from a previously completed simulation.
  One use for this is to start a finer resolution calculation using
  a coarser simulation.
  Another use could be to do a staged simulation: when extending the domain
  in a staged simulation, one might want to start with some blocks initialised
  from an earlier truncated domain simulation.
  The cells in the block are initialised by searching the `FlowSolution` for the
  nearest corresponding cell in the _old_ solution and copying that value.
  No attempt at interpolating based on nearby cells or mismatch in cell centres is made. +
   +
  A user-defined function can be provided as a Lua function.
  This allows one to provide a spatially-varying initial state.
  The function contract is: accepts `x`, `y` and `z` as parameters; returns a `FlowState`
  object.
  An example of initialising a shock tube with high and low pressure sections
  is shown in the 3D Sod shock tube case. See: `dgd/examples/eilmer/3D/sod-shock-tube/sg/sod.lua`. That initialisation function is repeated here:

   function tube_gas(x, y, z)
      if x < 0.5 then
         p = 1.0e5; T = 348.4
      else
         p = 1.0e4; T = 278.8
      end
   return FlowState:new{p=p, velx=0.0, vely=0.0, T=T}
   end

`bcList` ::
  _table_: `{north=BCObject, east=BCObject, south=BCObject, west=BCObject, [top=BCObject, bottom=BCObject]}` +
  The `bcList` is used to set boundary conditions on the faces of blocks
  with an underlying structured grid.
  Each table key accepts a boundary condition object.
  If any table entry is missing, the default-supplied boundary condition
  is a slip wall, `WallBC_WithSlip`.
  In 3D, the `top` and `bottom` faces can also be set.
  If a boundary is a connection, this can be explicitly set or you
  can rely on the `identifyBlockConnections()` helper function to
  make that connection for you.
  That helper function is called _after_ the blocks have been configured.
  An example to set a supersonic inflow on a west boundary, and
  an outflow on the north boundary is:

   bcList={west=InFlowBC_SupersonicIn:new{flowState=inflow},
           north=OutFlowBC_Simple:new{}}

`bcDict` ::
  _table_: `{tagA=BCObject, tagB=BCObject, ...}` +
  The `bcDict` is used to set boundary conditions on faces of blocks with an
  underlying unstructured grid.
  The tag strings in the table should match the tags used in the underlying
  unstructured grid.
  If a boundary face is not set explicitly in this table, then a default
  boundary condition of a slip wall is applied (`WallBC_WithSlip`).

`active` ::
  _bool_, default: `true` +
  By default, blocks are marked as _active_ for inclusion in the simulation.
  You could disable a block's participation in the simulation domain,
  setting this parameter to false.
  Be careful of how this block is connected to others if setting it
  to _inactive_;
  the flow state will not be updated in an _inactive_ block.

`label` ::
  _string_, default: `FluidBlock-<id>` +
  Set this parameter to give the block a label.
  This is a convenience for the user and might be useful for some
  custom post-processing to work with blocks that have a
  specific label.

`omegaz` ::
  _float_, default: `0.0` +
  angular speed (in rad/s about the _z_-axis) for the rotating frame of reference. +
  Useful for the calculation of flow in turbomachines.
  The default value of 0.0 implies no rotating frame.

`may_be_turbulent` ::
  _bool_, default: `true` +
  Normally, when a turbulence model is active, turbulent flow will be allowed in all blocks.
  This parameter may be set `false` to suppress the turbulence actions for the block.
  Use sparingly.

== FluidBlock arrays

To generate more than one FluidBlock on a single, structured grid, use

 FBArray:new{grid, nib, njb, nkb,
             initialState,
             bcList|bcDict,
             active, label, omegaz, may_be_turbulent}

The entries to the table are mostly the same as for the construction of a single
FluidBlock object.
The extra arguments are:

`nib` ::
  _int_, default 1 +
  The number of blocks in the i-index direction.

`njb` ::
  _int_, default 1 +
  The number of blocks in the j-index direction.

`nkb` ::
  _int_, default 1 +
  The number of blocks in the k-index direction.

The table that is returned contains an arrays of all of the FluidBlock objects defined
over the partitioned grid:

`blockArray` ::
  will be a multi-dimensional array, indexed as `[ib][jb][kb]`,
  with `1<=ib<=nib`, `1<=jb<=njb`, `1<=kb<=nkb`.


`blockCollection` ::
  will be a single-dimensional array, also starting at 1.
  Note that the index of the blocks within this array follow the Lua convention
  and will be different to the `id` assigned to the blocks, which will start at `0`,
  and thus align with the D-language indexing.

== SolidBlock objects

We decompose the solid simulation domain into blocks.
We call these units of decomposition `SolidBlocks`.
The configuration includes setting the solid properties, boundary conditions and the initial temperature.
The full list of options are described here.

SolidBlock:new{grid, initTemperature,
               bcList, active, label, properties}

`grid` ::
  `StructuredGrid` object, no default +
  A structured grid object must be supplied. The grid dimensions
  should also be compatible with the global setting for dimenions.
  (See: <<config-dimensions,`config.dimensions`>>)

`initTemperature` ::
    _float_, no default +
  The solid simulation domain requires an initial temperature throughout the domain.
  The temperature is set block-by-block using this `initTemperature` parameter.
  There is no default: the user must supply something for this parameter. +

`bcList` ::
  _table_: `{north=BCObject, east=BCObject, south=BCObject, west=BCObject, [top=BCObject, bottom=BCObject]}` +
  The `bcList` is used to set boundary conditions on the faces of blocks with an underlying structured grid.
  Each table key accepts a boundary condition object.
  If any table entry is missing, the default-supplied boundary condition
  is an adiabatic wall, `SolidAdiabaticBC`.
  In 3D, the `top` and `bottom` faces can also be set.
  If a boundary is a connection, this can be explicitly set or you
  can rely on the `identifyBlockConnections()` helper function to
  make that connection for you.
  That helper function is called _after_ the blocks have been configured.
  An example to set a fixed temperature on a west boundary, and
  a constant flux on the north boundary is:

   bcList={west=SolidFixedTBC:new{Twall=300.0},
           north=SolidConstantFluxBC:new{}}

`active` ::
  _bool_, default: `true` +
  By default, blocks are marked as _active_ for inclusion in the simulation.
  You could disable a block's participation in the simulation domain,
  setting this parameter to false.
  Be careful of how this block is connected to others if setting it
  to _inactive_;
  the flow state will not be updated in an _inactive_ block.

`label` ::
  _string_, default: `SolidBlock-<id>` +
  Set this parameter to give the block a label.
  This is a convenience for the user and might be useful for some
  custom post-processing to work with blocks that have a
  specific label.

`properties` ::
  _table_: `{rho=rho, k=k, Cp=Cp}` +
  The `properties` table is used to set the material-specific solid proprties where rho is the density, k is the thermal conductivity, and Cp is the specific heat capacity.

== SolidBlock arrays

To generate more than one SolidBlock on a single, structured grid, use

 SolidBlockArray:new{grid, nib, njb, nkb,
                     initTemperature,
                     bcList,
                     active, label, properties}

The entries to the table are mostly the same as for the construction of a single
SolidBlock object.
The extra arguments are:

`nib` ::
  _int_, default 1 +
  The number of blocks in the i-index direction.

`njb` ::
  _int_, default 1 +
  The number of blocks in the j-index direction.

`nkb` ::
  _int_, default 1 +
  The number of blocks in the k-index direction.

The table that is returned contains an arrays of all of the SolidBlock objects defined
over the partitioned grid:

`blockArray` ::
  will be a multi-dimensional array, indexed as `[ib][jb][kb]`,
  with `1<=ib<=nib`, `1<=jb<=njb`, `1<=kb<=nkb`.


`blockCollection` ::
  will be a single-dimensional array, also starting at 1.
  Note that the index of the blocks within this array follow the Lua convention
  and will be different to the `id` assigned to the blocks, which will start at `0`,
  and thus align with the D-language indexing.
