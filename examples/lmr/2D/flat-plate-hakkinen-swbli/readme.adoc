An oblique shock wave interacts with a laminar boundary layer on a flat flate.
The boundary layer can be seen as the warmer temperture gas close to the lower boundary.
The oblique shock generated at the leading edge of the upper boundary can be seen to arrive at
the plate a little after half-way along the flow domain.
