This example is a turbulent, supersonic flow over a flat plate at Mach 6.5,
from Ye and Morgan (1994). In T4, the boundary layer at this condition is
actually transitional, though here it is treated as fully turbulent from the
leading edge. Both structured and unstructured variants are available, and
the one equation "Edwards" variant of the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model
is used.
