This is example is used to simulate the flow past the FIRE-II reentry capsule
at the 1636s point on the trajectory, at an altitude of 71 km.
The free stream conditions are:
[stem]
++++
u_{\infty} = 11.3 km/s; T_{\infty} = 210 K; \rho_{\infty} = 8.57e-5 kg/m^3
++++

[TIP]
====
This example demonstrates how to:

. Setup a high-temperature gas model simulation (a two temperature, 11-species air model)
. Select a shock-fitting simulation
. Use a `ControlPointPatch` and manipulate some control points for fine-tuning of the grid
