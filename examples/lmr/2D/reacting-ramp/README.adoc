= Reacting premixed hydrogen over a 15 degree ramp

This example is an inviscid, reacting, supersonic flow at Mach 3.4, consisting
of a premixed hydrogen flow that impacts a 15 degree ramp. The subsequent
shock compression causes the flow to ignite, a process which is modelled
using the kinetic mechanism of Rogers and Schexnayder.

At present the ramp is solved first order, as I was mainly using it to
tinker with the species equations in the JFNK, however it should solve
second order with the correct limiter limiter settings.
