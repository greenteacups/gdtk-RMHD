# X2's 90%He/10%Ar 2 mm driver condition
# Empirical rupture Values from Table 2 of Gildfind et al. (2015)
# Free-piston driver performance characterisation using experimental shock speeds through helium
# for the 80%He no orifice plate version of this driver condition, but I figured that those numbers
# are better than nothing... (and 80%He should be similar to this condition than 100%He)
#
# I actually went through and changed M_throat to D_throat as to me it seems more 'physical' for the user.
