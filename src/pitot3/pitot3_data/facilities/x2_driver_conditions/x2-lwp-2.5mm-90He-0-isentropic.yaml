# X2's 90%He/10%Ar 2.5 mm driver condition with isentropic compression to the specified compression ratio
#
# The fill pressure is from Table 3 of Gildfind et al. (2011)
# “Free-Piston Driver Optimisation for Simulation of High Mach Number Scramjet Flow Conditions,” 
# Shock Waves, Vol. 21, No. 6, 2011, pp. 559–572.
# The compression ratio (lambda) is from Table 4 of the same paper.
#
# M_throat was calculated using the formula from Gildfind et al. (2015) 
# Free-piston driver performance characterisation using experimental shock speeds through helium.
# for the specified composition (which includes more helium than the original driver condition from Gildfind et al. (2011))
# “Free-Piston Driver Performance Characterisation Using Experimental Shock Speeds Through Helium,” 
# Shock Waves, Vol. 25, No. 2, 2015, pp. 169–176.
# the goal is to basically maintain the mass flow out of the driver per unit time as the driver condition becomes lighter,
# by constricting the driver exit. This means that driver performance changes but piston dynamics remain the same.
#
# This driver condition used to be specified with the rupture pressure (p4) of 35.7 MPa (35.7e6 Pa)
# but I have changed it to the compression ratio as it feels more physical.
# I have also specified D_throat instead of M_throat for a similar reason.
