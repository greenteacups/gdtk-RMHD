# X2's 100%He 2.5 mm driver condition with an empirical T4 value.
# Values from Figure 6.8 in Gildfind (2012) 
# Development of High Total Pressure Scramjet Flow Conditions using the X2 Expansion Tube
# M_throat for the 65 mm orifice plate is from the text of Gildfind et al. (2015) 
# Free-piston driver performance characterisation using experimental shock speeds through helium
# 
# I actually went through and changed M_throat to D_throat as to me it seems more 'physical' for the user.
