# X2's 95%He/5%Ar 1.2 mm thick diaphragm driver condition with empirically derived conditions
#
# The fill pressure and composition are from Table 3 of Gildfind et al. (2011)
# “Free-Piston Driver Optimisation for Simulation of High Mach Number Scramjet Flow Conditions,” 
# Shock Waves, Vol. 21, No. 6, 2011, pp. 559–572.
# 
# The original numbers used for this driver were empirical T4 and p4 values which I got from 
# David Gildfind at some point
# this driver was called 'lwp-1.2mm-dave-mhd' in PITOT2 and it was added to PITOT3 in September 2021
# it had a p4 = 8.89e6 Pa and a T4 = 1726.0 K
# From my recent analysis, it seems to be an isentropic compression with a compression ratio of 13.93
#
# Recently (i.e. 2023), while the isentropic compression driver does appear to overestimate shock speeds for this condition,
# this empirical driver has severely underpredicted things, probably due to changing diaphragm batches. So I sat down to make new numbers.
# I used the PITOT3 effective driver condition optimiser (see gdtk/examples/pitot3/pitot3_x2_effective_driver_condition_optimiser)
# to get compression ratios for several recent X2 experiments with 1.2 mm diaphragms and the results are listed below:
# shock tube shock speeds were sd1-sd3
# x2s5564, Daisy-May Air condition 1, 100%He, p1 = 50 kPa, test gas = Zero Air, effective compression ratio = 17.79
# x2s5566, Daisy-May Air condition 2, 80%He/20%Ar, p1 = 20 kPa, test gas = Zero Air, effective compression ratio = 17.62
# x2s5567, Wallington IXV Condition, 80%He/20%Ar, p1 = 9 kPa, test gas = Zero Air, effective compression ratio = 16.87
# x2s5617, Sam Lock Mars condition, 100%He, p1 = 10.5 kPa, test gas = CO2, effective compression ratio = 17.47
# taking the mean of all of these (17.79 + 17.62 + 16.87 + 17.47) / 4 = 17.4375
# this is between the design number of 19.4 and the last empirical value of 13.93 and it only has a standard deviation of
# 0.35 so it seems like a reasonable estimate for now, which may need to be updated again in the future.
#
# This driver condition will now be specified as an 'isentropic-compression-compression-ratio' driver with the found
# effective compression ratio. I will also take the opportunity to specify D_throat instead of M_throat as I have done
# with other driver conditions today too.
