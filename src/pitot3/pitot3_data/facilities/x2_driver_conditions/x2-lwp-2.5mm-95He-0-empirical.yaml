# X2's 95%He/5%Ar 2.5 mm driver condition with an empirical T4 value.
# Values from Figure 6.8 in Gildfind (2012) 
# Development of High Total Pressure Scramjet Flow Conditions using the X2 Expansion Tube
# M_throat was calculated using the formula from Gildfind et al. (2015) 
# Free-piston driver optimisation for simulation of high Mach number scramjet flow conditions 
#
# This is a new driver condition that I made after realising that there is a much larger gap in performance
# between the 90 and 100% He conditions than the 80 to 90 % He conditions. This should plug the gap nicely.
#
# I actually went through and changed M_throat to D_throat as to me it seems more 'physical' for the user.
