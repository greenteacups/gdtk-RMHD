# X2's 80%He/20%Ar 2.5 mm driver condition with an empirical T4 value.
# Values from Figure 6.8 in Gildfind (2012) 
# Development of High Total Pressure Scramjet Flow Conditions using the X2 Expansion Tube

# I actually went through and changed M_throat to D_throat as to me it seems more 'physical' for the user.
