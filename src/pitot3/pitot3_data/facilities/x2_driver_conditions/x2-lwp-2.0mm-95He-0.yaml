# X2's 95%He/5%Ar 2 mm driver condition
# Empirical rupture Values from Table 2 of Gildfind et al. (2015)
# Free-piston driver performance characterisation using experimental shock speeds through helium
# for the 80%He no orifice plate version of this driver condition, but I figured that those numbers
# are better than nothing... (and 80%He should be similar to this condition than 100%He)
#
# This is a new driver condition that I made after realising that there is a much larger gap in performance
# between the 90 and 100% He conditions than the 80 to 90 % He conditions. This should plug the gap nicely.
#
# I actually went through and changed M_throat to D_throat as to me it seems more 'physical' for the user.
