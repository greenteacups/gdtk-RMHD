-- N2/O2 with ions CEA backed gas model
-- This is to simulate the synthetic Zero air which is currently used for most X2 experiments.
-- Details about the synthetic air can be found here:
-- https://www.coregas.com.au/gases/air/zero-air
-- Composition is 21%O2+-0.5% with an N2 balance.
-- I got the species list from intuition and various old PITOT runs with this composition.

-- updated 14/09/21 when I realised that I was mising NO+ in the species list... CMJ
-- updated the trace to 1.0e-10 as running the CEA calculations in massf (which is the GDTk's only way to do it)
-- suppresses ionisation otherwise as electrons are very light so their mass fraction is very small
