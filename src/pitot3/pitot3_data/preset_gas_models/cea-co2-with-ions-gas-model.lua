-- CO2 with ions CEA backed gas model
-- I got the species list from old PITOT code runs with CO2 at various conditions.
-- This was the list below:
-- {'CO2','C2O','CO','O3','O2','O','C2','C','C2+','CO+','C+','C-','O+','O-','e-'}
-- I then went into CEA to check the full set of species and added any other species which did not cause
-- PITOT3 to fail when setting up the test gas state at room temperature. I added C302, C3, and O2+.

-- updated the trace to 1.0e-10 as running the CEA calculations in massf (which is the GDTk's only way to do it)
-- suppresses ionisation otherwise as electrons are very light so their mass fraction is very small
