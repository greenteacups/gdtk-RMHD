-- Mars (C02,N2) with ions CEA backed gas model
-- This is a simpler Mars entry gas composition which is normally used in our lab,
-- and was also used in the old PITOT code which just used CO2 and N2.
-- This composition is used in Cruden et al. (2012):
-- Absolute Radiation Measurement in Venus and Mars Entry Conditions
-- Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets
-- and a lot of work from our lab such as Troy Eichmann's PhD:
-- Radiation Measurements in a Simulated Mars Atmosphere (2012)
-- I got the species list from my working co2-with-ions species list and species I added after doing
-- old PITOT code runs with this composition at various conditions to see what the N2 added.
-- Chris James (c.james4@uq.edu.au) - 12/06/21
-- updated the trace to 1.0e-10 as running the CEA calculations in massf (which is the GDTk's only way to do it)
-- suppresses ionisation otherwise as electrons are very light so their mass fraction is very small
