-- Mars (C02,N2,Ar) with ions CEA backed gas model
-- The old PITOT code had Mars gas defined as just CO2 and N2, which seemed to be a common
-- older composiiton, but this version adds Argon.
-- The composition is based on what was used in Cruden et al. (2016):
-- Radiative Heating During Mars Science Laboratory Entry: Simulation, Ground Test, and Flight
-- Journal of Thermophysics and Heat Transfer
-- I got the species list from my working co2-with-ions species list and species I added after doing
-- old PITOT code runs with this composition at various conditions to see what the N2 and Ar added.

-- updated the trace to 1.0e-10 as running the CEA calculations in massf (which is the GDTk's only way to do it)
-- suppresses ionisation otherwise as electrons are very light so their mass fraction is very small
